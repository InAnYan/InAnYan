# Hi, there!

I'm Ruslan. I'm a university student from **Ukraine** with a passion for understanding how computers work at every level.

My primary programming language is **Rust**, and I'm currently specializing in **LLM research** and development of **AI applications**. I know and fluent in other PLs as well.

I was also a **[GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) 2024 student at [JabRef](https://github.com/JabRef)**! I was **integrating modern AI technologies** into JabRef application and learned a lot about development process in the team of professionals.

On GitHub you can find:

- My **old projects** when programming was primarily my hobby. Though, maybe I add there more.
- My **research** in [papers repository](https://github.com/InAnYan/papers).

Feel free to connect! I'm always eager to collaborate and learn from others.
